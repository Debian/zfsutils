  * Add Arno Töll to Uploaders and set Dm-Upload-Allowed accordingly.
  * Add crontab file to run a monthly scrub of all pools.  Stolen from
    mdadm (thanks martin f. krafft).

  [ Arni Töll ]

    been provided by the zfsutils source package as they randomly break upon
    upgrades as upstream does not provide any version information along the
    exported symbols.
  * Improve several package descriptions (e.g. remove redundancies)
  * Rename XC-Package-Type control field to Package-Type. That's supported as of
    dpkg-dev 1.15.7,

    + 04_stdint.diff: Extend inclusion of stdint.h to several new files

    + Add 15_pthread_compat.diff: Work around compatibility issues with eglibc
    + Remove 15_ztest.fix entirely

  * debian/rules:
    + Rework get-orig-source target, add new origin paths where needed.

    not available anymore; also stop on runlevel 1.
  * Fix manpage hyphens and convert into spaces.

  * Set "X-Start-Before: checkroot" so that boot doesn't break when

    system if their mountpoints collide (typical in a dual-boot
    machine). Use /etc/fstab instead.
  * Set "X-Stop-After: umountfs" to ensure ZVOLs are no longer in use
    when "zfs volfini" is called.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
